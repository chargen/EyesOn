# Eyes On ...

## About

Eyes On ... is an iPhone app for giving things you love a photographic hug.

In practical terms, this means you take photos of something, say Sutro Tower in San Francisco, from whatever angle you happen to be at. The app geotags the photo and uploads to the server, which is collecting everyone's photos of Sutro Tower.

Then, from either a web site or within the app, you can browse everyone's photos in a geospatial manner. That is, you can zoom in and out and pan left and right, always encircling Sutro Tower. It will be a neat effect!

## HIGH LEVEL ROADMAP

- Make an app that takes a photo and uploads to the server
- Get a bunch of people to start taking photos
- Build the web based Viewer
- Make a phone based Viewer
